Notes:
- There were earlier server files under `server/` during the session (Express, authRoutes, models) which were later removed from the root per user's instruction; backups may exist in `frontend/` or elsewhere depending on earlier moves.
- If you need a complete file-by-file manifest, I can produce one by scanning the repository and saving to this file.
