Chat & Project Snapshot
Date: 2025-11-07

This file is an automated snapshot summarizing the conversation and main actions performed during the session.

Summary (short):
- Built a frontend React app (Create React App) for a quiz application. Implemented sidebar, navbar (header), hero/home page, exam card component, and many placeholder pages for admin and user flows.
- Backend was prototyped earlier (Express + Mongoose + JWT auth) but later removed at the user's request; the session focused on the frontend.
- Integrated user-provided screenshots into the workspace (images) and mapped each screenshot to a page. Started iterating to make the UI match the screenshots.
- Handled dev-server port conflicts and started the CRA dev server locally.

Key files created/edited (non-exhaustive):
- client/src/components/common/Sidebar.js (polished sidebar with NavLink and icons)
- client/src/components/common/Navbar.js (polished header with search, actions, avatar)
- client/src/components/common/Footer.js (placeholder file present)
- client/src/pages/user/UserHome.js (hero + exams grid added, uses /frontend images)
- client/src/components/user/UserExamCard.js (exam card markup)
- client/src/styles/App.css (global styles, sidebar, navbar, hero, cards)
- client/src/index.js (imported Font Awesome CSS)
- frontend/public/images/IMG-20251107-WA0001.jpg ... IMG-20251107-WA0013.jpg (screenshot assets; may be located under `frontend/` depending on earlier workspace moves)

Notes & next steps (recommended):
- If you want persistent backend functionality, restore the previously implemented server folder or re-add Express/Mongo wiring and provide a MONGO_URI.
- To create an archive (zip) of the project locally, run the provided PowerShell script `quick_snapshot.ps1` located in this SAVE/ folder.
